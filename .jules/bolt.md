## 2024-05-20 - Expensive operations inside render/filter loops
**Learning:** Found multiple instances where invariant expensive operations (like `toLowerCase()`, `startOfDay(parseISO())`) were being run inside `.filter()` callbacks or un-memoized during every render, leading to O(n) redundant work.
**Action:** Always extract invariant calculations outside of loops and use `useMemo` for array filtering operations based on state.

## 2025-05-24 - Expensive string parsing inside sort comparator loops
**Learning:** Sorting data using `.sort((a,b) => new Date(a.date).getTime() - new Date(b.date).getTime())` with string formats like 'MMM dd' is highly inefficient because it re-runs `new Date(string)` multiple times during the sort process (O(N log N)). It can also cause unexpected timezone/year issues when only parsing a month and day.
**Action:** Cache the deterministic numeric timestamp during the O(N) map/reduce aggregation loop and use those cached numeric values in the `Array.prototype.sort()` comparator (O(1) subtraction operation instead of string parsing).

## 2024-05-25 - Redundant serialization in event broadcasting
**Learning:** Found an $O(n)$ performance bottleneck where `JSON.stringify` was being called inside an `sseClients.forEach` loop during Server-Sent Events (SSE) broadcasting. This resulted in the same exact payload being stringified redundantly for every single connected client, causing unnecessary CPU cycles and memory allocations that scale linearly with active connections.
**Action:** Extract expensive and invariant data transformations (like `JSON.stringify`) out of loops that iterate over connection pools. Pre-compute the serialized payload once, store it in a variable, and write the static string to all clients.

## 2025-05-27 - O(N) re-renders due to un-memoized heavy component parsing
**Learning:** Found an O(N) performance bottleneck in the `Chatbot` component where chat messages were being rendered inside a `.map` loop without memoization. Because each message uses `ReactMarkdown`, which performs expensive DOM parsing/rendering, the entire chat history was being re-parsed on every parent state update (e.g., when typing in the input field).
**Action:** Extract expensive item rendering logic within lists into a separate component (e.g., `MessageItem`) and wrap it with `React.memo()` so that only new items are parsed/rendered, significantly reducing CPU overhead during state updates.
