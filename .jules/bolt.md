## 2024-05-20 - Expensive operations inside render/filter loops
**Learning:** Found multiple instances where invariant expensive operations (like `toLowerCase()`, `startOfDay(parseISO())`) were being run inside `.filter()` callbacks or un-memoized during every render, leading to O(n) redundant work.
**Action:** Always extract invariant calculations outside of loops and use `useMemo` for array filtering operations based on state.

## 2025-05-24 - Expensive string parsing inside sort comparator loops
**Learning:** Sorting data using `.sort((a,b) => new Date(a.date).getTime() - new Date(b.date).getTime())` with string formats like 'MMM dd' is highly inefficient because it re-runs `new Date(string)` multiple times during the sort process (O(N log N)). It can also cause unexpected timezone/year issues when only parsing a month and day.
**Action:** Cache the deterministic numeric timestamp during the O(N) map/reduce aggregation loop and use those cached numeric values in the `Array.prototype.sort()` comparator (O(1) subtraction operation instead of string parsing).

## 2024-05-25 - Redundant serialization in event broadcasting
**Learning:** Found an $O(n)$ performance bottleneck where `JSON.stringify` was being called inside an `sseClients.forEach` loop during Server-Sent Events (SSE) broadcasting. This resulted in the same exact payload being stringified redundantly for every single connected client, causing unnecessary CPU cycles and memory allocations that scale linearly with active connections.
**Action:** Extract expensive and invariant data transformations (like `JSON.stringify`) out of loops that iterate over connection pools. Pre-compute the serialized payload once, store it in a variable, and write the static string to all clients.

## 2026-10-08 - O(N) Re-parsing bottleneck in Chatbot Markdown rendering
**Learning:** Found a performance bottleneck where a `messages.map()` loop rendered `ReactMarkdown` directly for a Chatbot interface. Every single keystroke in the input field updated the parent component's state, causing an O(N) re-render and re-parsing of all previously sent markdown messages.
**Action:** Always extract individual list items with expensive render operations (like Markdown parsing) into their own standalone component and wrap them in `React.memo()`. This ensures older elements in the list only render once and do not re-render on parent state changes unrelated to their props.
