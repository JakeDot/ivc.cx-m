## 2024-05-20 - Expensive operations inside render/filter loops
**Learning:** Found multiple instances where invariant expensive operations (like `toLowerCase()`, `startOfDay(parseISO())`) were being run inside `.filter()` callbacks or un-memoized during every render, leading to O(n) redundant work.
**Action:** Always extract invariant calculations outside of loops and use `useMemo` for array filtering operations based on state.
